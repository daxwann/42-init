# Explain how connect yourself as new user. (With graphic session and ssh session)

In GUI mode, you first log on as a current user, and then in Account Settings, unlock as Administrator, then create new user. Then switch user to the newly created user.

In headless mode, you can ssh into the VM with this command 
`ssh -p <port> <currentusername>@<host_ip>`. 
In the new shell, switch user to root with `su` command. Add a new user with `adduser` command. Then switch to that new user.
